#' grapherator: A Toolbox for the Multi-Criteria Minimum Spanning Tree Problem.
#'
#' Due to lack of real world graphs, e.g., the optimization community often
#' relies on artificial graph problems. The \pkg{grapherator} package implements
#' a multi-step approach for the generation of weighted graphs.
